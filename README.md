# 1-Byte-Memory-using-BJT

I designed and built a 1-byte memory module using transistors - 2N2222 BJTs, on LTSpice.

Basic Logic Gates:
I began by constructing fundamental logic gates—NAND, NOR, and NOT—using transistor-based circuits.

8-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC):
Next, I created an 8-bit DAC to convert digital signals into analog waveforms. This helped me understand how digital logic can be applied to real-world signal processing.

Sequential Logic Elements:
I then moved on to sequential logic, first building a basic SR latch. After that, I added a clock signal to turn the SR latch into an SR flip-flop. Finally, I used the SR flip-flop as a foundation to build a D flip-flop, which is essential for memory applications.

1-Byte Memory Module:
I integrated all these modules together to create a fully functional 1-byte memory. This memory can store and retrieve digital data, demonstrating the practical application of the logic and sequential circuits I built earlier.

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in digital electronics—from basic logic gates to a complete memory system—all realized using transistor hardware.
